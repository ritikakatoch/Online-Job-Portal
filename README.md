# New technology explanation: 

## 🤷‍♂️Why we are Redux selected?
Redux is most useful in cases when we have large amounts of application states that are needed in many places in the app. The app state is updated frequently. The logic of updating that state may be complex. The app has a medium or large-sized codebase and might be worked on by many people. Redux is more flexible we don’t need to Props drilling without component architect changes to manage the states. Not only that it also includes Predictable behavior, Centralized, and Debuggable above the reason we selected Redux.


## 🔥Our Main Goal Using Redux:
While it’s mostly used as a state management tool with React, we can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library. It’s lightweight at 2KB (including dependencies), so we don’t have to worry about it making our application’s asset size bigger.
With Redux, the state of our application is kept in a store, and each component can access any state that it needs from this store. So, our main goal is globally managing application states and updating the UI optimistically.
